# Stonks

Stonks is a Backtest for technical indicators and strategies using only pandas. 

 ## The story
Among the key criteria, based on which we decided to choose the best project idea, is innovation. We did not want to work on something generic and easy. Thus we opted for this idea, since none of us knew the best course of action in creating an automated trading bot. It was a thrilling experience in which we learned a lot, mainly because this is a whole new field. Of course the aquired knowledge from our studies helped us get a good headstart. And most importantly, this was the biggest team-project, so we were afraid of the challenges we were going to face. But we were able to pull through thanks to collective effort and communication.

## Installation

To run the bot clone this repository on your local machine.

## Usage
Once you're in the directory run this command to get started
```

```
